  caveats <<~EOS
    loki is not signed with an Apple Developer ID, so macOS will call the download "damaged" the
    first time. Clear the quarantine flag once and it opens:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/loki.app
    (or open it, dismiss the dialog, and allow it under System Settings › Privacy & Security).
